# SGCalc
SGCalc is a golf round analysis application based on the "Strokes Gained" methodology by Mark Broadie. In short, by comparing individual shots of your round to the performance of pro players on those same shots, the strengths and weaknesses in your golf game can be assessed quantitatively. SGCalc allows users to input the relevant data for their rounds and see immediate shot by shot analysis, as well as breakdowns of the broader areas of their game (tee shots, approach shots, putting, etc.).  

SGCalc is a rails based project utilizing Bootstrap for stlying and some light JavaScript where necessary. This project began as a collaboration with a friend at a time when a web app for calculating Strokes Gained did not exist. Unfortunatley, some high profile competition emerged before I could finish the app, but as a hobby project, its been fun to tinker with in my spare time.  
### To do list
Some key features I'd like to add:
- user accounts (likely through Devise)
- streamline the process for inputting round info, allow multiple shots to be added at once
- Provide more and better stats to the user
